# Accessible University (AU) Demo Site 

Accessible University (AU) is a fictional university home page designed to demonstrate a variety of common web design problems that result in visitors with disabilities being unable to access content or features. 

AU was originally developed by [AccessIT](http://washington.edu/accessit) and is maintained by [AccessComputing](http://washington.edu/accesscomputing), both projects based out of the University of Washington. Use the AU site to:
1. demonstrate common web accessibility principles at trainings, presentations, and workshops on accessible web design.
2. learn common web accessibility problems and solutions in an easy-to-understand way.

See AU in action at [uw.edu/accesscomputing/AU](http://washington.edu/accesscomputing/AU).
