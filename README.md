Design Eye for A11y

OneWeek Hackathon 2018 project: The goal of this project is to create and train an AI model that is able to scan web pages and fill in blanks in the UIA tree that the developer of the web page missed in construction. This will then provide a better experience to blind users that use Narrator for example. The proof of concept will be in the form of a Microsoft Edge extension.
