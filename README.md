-Design Eye for A11y-

OneWeek Hackathon 2018 project: https://garagehackbox.azurewebsites.net/hackathons/1214/projects/70460

The goal of this project is to create and train an AI model that when shown web pages can fill in blanks in the UIA tree that the developer of the web page missed during construction. This will provide a better experience to users with visual impairments that use Narrator for example. 

The proof of concept will be in the form of a Microsoft Edge extension and will take a mocked-up page with username and password fields not labelled in the HTML and will scan the page and pull the labelling info out.
