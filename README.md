-Seeing UI-

OneWeek Hackathon 2018 project: https://garagehackbox.azurewebsites.net/hackathons/1214/projects/70460

The goal of this project is to show that we can create and train an AI model that when shown web pages can fill in blanks in the UIA tree that the developer of the web page did not fill in. This will help to provide a better experience to users with visual impairments through Narrator for example. 

The proof of concept will be in the form of a Microsoft Edge extension and will scan a mocked-up page with username and password fields not labelled in the HTML and will extract the labelling info out.
